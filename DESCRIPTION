Description: A collection of utilities for navigating medical image data. The DICOM and NIfTI formats
  are supported. Functions provide simple interfaces to the data and metadata contained in these formats.
  A particular emphasis on metadata allows simple conversion of image metadata to familiar R data structures
  such as lists and data frames. Where possible, generic functions can silently process either DICOM or
  NIfTI data. Additionally, image data can be extracted and viewed.
